Outside of academics, my hobbies include working out, playing football🏈 and basketball🏀, hiking🏃, playing PUBG mobile, watching YouTube videos, and more. As I went to high school near Chicago, I am a big Chicago Bears fan! 🐻⬇️

This page serve as a place to keep all random things about me.

### RMP highlights

Recording the most interesting rate my professor reviews I have seen so far:

- This review made me scared of the DSC major. I'm glad I didn't believe it, lol.

- I bet you 1000 bucks that these two reviews came from the same person.

### A silly mistake 🤯

Check out this simple problem; it was so easy that I could have solved it when I was in 10th grade. However, I ended up breaking my cumulative 4.0 in my sophomore year just because of this problem. 😅 I put this image here just to remind myself daily to always check my work, no matter how easy a question might look.

What will happen if you call your 65-year-old track coach by his first name? (This was for a social experiment in my AP Psychology class).
