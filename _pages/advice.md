#### Course Recommendation

1. CSE 151B/251B with Prof. [Gary Cottrell](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/). ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - One of the toughest classes at UCSD if you have no experience is AI/ML. However, you will be able to gain a lot from it if you devote your time.

2. CSE 250A with Prof. [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/). ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - A solid substitute for DSC 140A if you are a data science major student. Prof. Berg-Kirkpatrick's lectures are some of the best I have seen at UCSD.

3. COGS 118A with Prof. [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/) or [Jason Fleischer](https://jgfleischer.com/). ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - I did not take their offering of COGS 118A, but the course designed by either of them is good for an introduction to machine learning.

4. MATH 173A/B with Prof. [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/). ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - I did not take Prof. Saab's offering of the MATH 173 sequence. However, he designed this great sequence, and he is really good at explaining mathematical concepts based on my experience of working with him on a project.




#### Schedule Planning

If you are interested in taking classes together, please find my quarter-by-quarter plan below. Please note that this plan is tentative and subject to change. If you would like to discuss potential classes, group projects, or simply connect with me, please do not hesitate to reach out via email, Zoom, or by arranging a meeting at the Geisel Library.

I have been assisting fellow students with schedule planning since my freshman year, and I am happy to help with any questions you may have regarding scheduling if you are in a similar major or from the same college (Warren).

#### Becoming an IA 

Since my freshman year, I have been serving as an Instructional Assistant at UCSD, and have provided numerous suggestions and tips to fellow students regarding the application process for various positions in different departments. If you are interested in becoming a Math TA, CSE Tutor, DSC Tutor, or Econ UIA, I would be more than happy to offer guidance and advice. Please do not hesitate to contact me.
