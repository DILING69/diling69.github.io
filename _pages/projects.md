1. TOC

#### Image Captioning

* Researched different hyperparameters on Long-Short-Term-Memory, Vanilla, and custom Recurrent Neural Networks on the COCO dataset to optimize image captioning.
* Achieved 66.7% BLEU-1 score and 7.69% BLEU-4 score on the testing dataset.

#### Image Classification

* Optimized Convolutional Neural Network on custom and pre-trained models to classify the Food101 dataset. Achieved 78% testing accuracy to classify 20 different classes of food images.
* Used regularization and momentum to optimize classifying handwritten Japanese Hiragana characters (KMNIST dataset) on back-propagation, logistic regression, and softmax regression. Achieved 87.25% testing accuracy on a multi-layer neural network with forward and backward propagation on 10 different classes; 98% testing accuracy on classifying two classes via logistic regression, and 70% testing accuracy on classifying 10 classes via softmax regression.

#### Taming COVID-19 Statistics to Reflect Happiness Score Metrics

* For the goal of promoting Covid-19 vaccinations to antivaccinists, researched how the onset of vaccination, the vaccination rates, and the death rate in a country are related to the happiness score of that country.
* Collected datasets on Covid-19 vaccination records, happiness scores by country, and population reports. Designed metrics and performed data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis to find meaningful patterns. Built statistical models and machine learning pipelines to further analyze the problem.
* Detected trends that countries have earlier access to Covid-19 vaccines and were vaccinating faster have higher happiness scores.


#### Party Affiliation of Congressmen by their Stock Trades
* Cleaned the dataset and imputed missing values with different statistical techniques. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, Hypothesis tests, and Permutation tests to detect Congressmen's stock preferences on companies and industries from both parties.
* Extracted useful features from the dataset and built binary classification models to predict the party affiliation of Congressmen based on the information of their stock trades. Achieved 87.32% accuracy in determining the party affiliation after fine-tuning.


#### Crime Index and Wealth Analysis

* Collected and cleaned data of neighborhoods around San Diego from ArcGIS, and performed exploratory data analysis on average wealth in the communities and their corresponding crime indexes.
* Built data visualization and performed A\|B testings to better explain our variables, built machine learning pipelines for predictive analysis, and applied geospatial analysis to support our findings that areas with higher average household income are generally more robust to crimes.
