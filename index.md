## About MeüíØ

Hello there, my name is **Jiesen Zhang (Âº†Êù∞Ê£Æ)**. I am a rising senior studying Data Science and Cognitive Science at UCSD. I am deeply interested in the theories of machine learning and deep learning, and how understanding them can help us ensure safe and ethical practices in the field.

I am also a 9-time teaching assistant at UCSD. I've supported 4 DS/ML courses from both the Data Science and the Cognitive Science departments, collaborating with 5 faculty members and aiding over 1,000 students in their academic journeys, in which I am primarily mentored by Professor [Kyle Shannon](https://www.kmshannon.com/about/).

In my free time, I enjoy studying music and cinema. I play both guitar and bass in various bands, and I also have a passion for photography, particularly film photography.
