## About Me

Hello there, my name is **Jiesen Zhang (Âº†Êù∞Ê£Æ)**. I am a rising senior studying Data Science and Cognitive Science at UCSD. I am deeply interested in the theories of machine learning and deep learning, and how understanding them can help us ensure safe and ethical practices in the field.

I have served as a teaching assistant at UCSD for 11 times, contributing to **seven** Data Science and Machine Learning courses within both the Data Science and Cognitive Science departments. During this time, I have collaborated with five faculty members and supported over 1,000 students. I am primarily mentored by Professor [Kyle Shannon](https://www.kmshannon.com/about/).

In my free time, I enjoy studying music and cinema. I play both guitar and bass in various bands, and I also have a passion for photography, particularly film photography.
