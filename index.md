## 💯 About Me

Hello! I am an incoming third-year student at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), double majoring in [Data Science (BS)](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/academics/undergraduate/major-requirements/) under the [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/) and [Joint Major of Mathematics and Economics (BS)](https://economics.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/major-minor-requirements/joint-econ-math-major-ba.html) under the [Department of Economics](https://economics.ucsd.edu/).

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist Intern at Qualcomm Institute under the supervision of Dr. Ganz Chockalingam for healthcare-related projects and as a Data Science Research Assistant at the Institute for Neural Computation under the supervision of a Ph.D. Candidate Margot Wagner researching Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development.
I am genuinely interested in applying my data science, machine learning, deep learning, and economics knowledge in the industry. In particular, financial engineering, data analytics, etc. If you see me as a good fit for your open positions, please reach out! (To learn more about me, feel free to browse through other pages of this web!)

Outside of academics, my hobbies include working out, playing football🏈, playing basketball🏀, hiking🏃, playing PUBG mobile, watching YouTube videos, and etc. I am a big Chicago Bears fan as I went to high school near Chicago! 🐻⬇️


#### To friends at UCSD: 
Attatched is my [quarter-by-quarter](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ek3O-82N03V74gCj7gNwxCFUvHRsiD8z1JVo8XqOUFo/edit?usp=sharing) plan (subject to change). Feel free to chat with me (emial, zoom, or even at Geisel Library) if you want to take classes or hangout together!

As I have been serving as an Instructional Assistant at UCSD since the winter quarter of my freshman year, I have provided many suggestions and tips to my friends on how to apply these positions in differnet departments. If you are intrested in becoming Math TA's, DSC Tutors, or Econ UIA's, feel free to reach out as well.
