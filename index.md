## About MeüíØ

Hello! My name is **Weiyue Li (ÊùéÂ®ÅÂ≤≥)**. I am an incoming graduate student in Data Science at Harvard University. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) with triple majors in B.S. in Data Science, B.S. in Applied Mathematics, and B.A. in Economics. I'm broadly interested in aligning vision and language, multimodality, and domain generalization in AI/ML applications, as well as in improving the reasoning capabilities and robustness of large language models.

<!-- I primarily center my research around machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI/ML). I place particular emphasis on <u>large language models</u>, <u>computer vision</u>, and the <u>practical aspects of domain generalization and transfer</u> ‚Äî especially at their intersections. Leveraging my expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis, I've made significant contributions to various research and internship projects in the healthcare industry. -->

<!-- I was fortunte to be advised by Professor [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/) on a multimodality LLM project, Professor [Hao Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haozhang/) on my data science senior capstone project which recived the outstanding capstone project award, Professor [Mingxiong Huang](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/node/516) on a healthcare deep learning project, and Professor [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/) on a data analysis project. Prior to these, I had the privilege of working in Professor [Terry Sejnowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Sejnowski)'s Computational Neurobiology Laboratory ([CNL](https://cnl.salk.edu/)) on a healthcare deep learning project, where Dr. [Margot Wagner](https://www.margotwagner.com/) was my mentor. -->

I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/) on a multimodality LLM project, Professor [Hao Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haozhang/) on a prompt understanding and t2i benchmarking project, which received the Outstanding Capstone Project Award, Professor [Mingxiong Huang](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/node/516) on a healthcare deep learning project, and Professor [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/) on a data analysis project.

<!-- I'm interning at Professor [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/)'s Machine Learning, Perception, and Cognition Lab (mlPC), where I'm working on Multimodality and LLM projects. I was also fortunate to receive guidance from Professor [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/), Professor [Mingxiong Huang](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/node/516), and Dr. [Ganz Chockalingam](https://pdel.ucsd.edu/people/research-affiliates/ganz-chockalingam.html) for other AI/ML application-based research projects. Prior to this, I had the privilege of working in Professor [Terry Sejnowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Sejnowski)'s Computational Neurobiology Laboratory ([CNL](https://cnl.salk.edu/)) on a healthcare deep learning project, where Dr. [Margot Wagner](https://www.margotwagner.com/) was my mentor. Learn more at [Research](/research). -->


I was also a 22-time teaching assistant at UCSD. I've supported 14 DS/ML courses across the CS, DS, CogSci, Econ, and Math departments, collaborating with 21 faculty members and aiding over 3,000 students in their academic journeys. I am primarily mentored by [Suraj Rampure](https://rampure.org/), Dr. [Marina Langlois](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/people/marina-langlois/), and Professor [Tauhidur Rahman](https://www.tauhidurrahman.com/). I received the 2024 Jeffrey B. Remmel Award for Academic Excellence for my academic performance and contribution to the data science community at UCSD.



<!-- Beyond research, I have a deep passion for education. As an 21-time undergraduate teaching assistant, I've supported 13 courses across the Computer Science and Engineering, Data Science, Economics, and Mathematics departments, aiding over 3,000 students in their academic journeys. Collaborating with 20 faculty members, I've sought to elevate the course experiences for UCSD students. In my teaching endeavors, I am primarily mentored by [Suraj Rampure](https://rampure.org/), Dr. [Marina Langlois](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/people/marina-langlois/), and Professor [Tauhidur Rahman](https://www.tauhidurrahman.com/).

<!-- **I am expected to graduate in March 2024 and I am actively seeking internship opportunities in summer 2024 in AI/ML or Data Analysis related fields. You can find a copy of my [resume here (coming soon)]()**. -->
