## About MeüíØ

Hello! My name is Weiyue Li (ÊùéÂ®ÅÂ≤≥) and I am a third-year undergraduate student at University of California San Diego, pursuing a triple major in Data Science (BS), Applied Mathematics (BS), and Economics (BA). I am a Provost Honor recipient every academic quarter and a member of the Warren College Honor Society.

I am deeply committed to becoming a data scientist with a particular focus on machine learning, specifically, the practical aspects of domain generalization and transfer. My expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis has allowed me to make valuable contributions to multiple research and internship projects spanning industries such as healthcare, economics, semiconductors, and computer hardware.

Currently, I have the good fortune of working in Professor [Terry Sejnowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Sejnowski)'s lab on an applied deep learning project advised by [Margot Wagner](https://www.margotwagner.com/). I am also advised by [Weitang Liu](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/weitangliu/) on a sample efficient algorithm on computer vision project. In addition, I am advised by Professor [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/) and Dr. [Ganz Chockalingam](https://pdel.ucsd.edu/people/research-affiliates/ganz-chockalingam.html) for other application-based research projects.


Moreover, I am passionate about education. As an undergraduate teaching assistant, I have assisted in more than 10 courses offered by the Data Science, Mathematics, and Economics departments, helping over 2000 students. I have also worked with more than 10 teaching faculties to enhance the course experience for students at UCSD.

### To friends at UCSDüî±:

#### Schedule Planning

If you are interested in taking classes together, please find my quarter-by-quarter plan below. Please note that this plan is tentative and subject to change. If you would like to discuss potential classes, group projects, or simply connect with me, please do not hesitate to reach out via email, Zoom, or by arranging a meeting at the Geisel Library.

I have been assisting fellow students with schedule planning since my freshman year, and I am happy to help with any questions you may have regarding scheduling if you are in a similar major or from the same college (Warren).

#### Becoming an IA 

Since my freshman year, I have been serving as an Instructional Assistant at UCSD, and have provided numerous suggestions and tips to fellow students regarding the application process for various positions in different departments. If you are interested in becoming a Math TA, DSC Tutor, or Econ UIA, I would be more than happy to offer guidance and advice. Please do not hesitate to contact me.
