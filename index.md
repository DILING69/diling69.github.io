## About MeüíØ

Hello! My name is **Weiyue Li (ÊùéÂ®ÅÂ≤≥)**, and I am an incoming fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of California San Diego (UCSD), pursuing a triple major in Data Science (BS), Applied Mathematics (BS), and Economics (BA).

**I am expected to graduate in March 2024 and I am actively seeking internship opportunities in summer 2024 in AI/ML or Data Analysis related fields. You can find a copy of my [resume here (coming soon)]()**.

My academic interests focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI/ML), specifically on the practical aspects of domain generalization and transfer. My expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis has allowed me to make valuable contributions to multiple research and internship projects spanning industries such as healthcare, economics, semiconductors, and computer hardware.

Currently, I am advised by Dr. [Yifan Xu](https://yfxu.com/) on a visual LLM project. I am also advised by [Weitang Liu](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/weitangliu/) on a project about sample-efficient algorithms in computer vision. In addition, I am advised by Professor [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/), Professor [Mingxiong Huang](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/node/516), and Dr. [Ganz Chockalingam](https://pdel.ucsd.edu/people/research-affiliates/ganz-chockalingam.html) for other application-based research projects. Before that, I had the good fortune of working in Professor [Terry Sejnowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Sejnowski)'s lab on an applied deep learning project advised by Dr. [Margot Wagner](https://www.margotwagner.com/).

Moreover, I am passionate about education. As an undergraduate teaching assistant, I have assisted in more than 10 courses offered by the Computer Science and Engineering, Data Science, Mathematics, and Economics departments, helping over 2000 students. I have also worked with more than 10 teaching faculties to enhance the course experience for students at UCSD.

### To friends at UCSDüî±:

Growing up at UCSD, I have met many upperclassmen who have helped me become who I am today. If you are an undergraduate student at UCSD looking for **advice**, please see [here](/advice). If you are looking for some of the **useful resources** at UCSD, please see [here](/resources).
